## Secondary Layer
- Progress ring, weekly minutes, and status chips.
- Focus plan and insight cards.

## Tertiary Layer
- Library lists and support notes.

## Hierarchy Mechanics
- Display font reserved for headings only.
- Body font for instructions and metadata.
- Accent color reserved for CTAs and progress.
- Cards share consistent elevation to reduce visual noise.
