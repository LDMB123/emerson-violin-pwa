# ADR-0008: Kid-First Daily Practice + Rewards Framing

- Status: accepted
- Date: 2026-02-03

## Context
- Primary user is an 8-year-old; flow must be short, clear, and tap-friendly
- Daily habit needs a single "Start" path with minimal reading
- Parent settings must be gated without accounts

## Decision
- Add a Daily Practice view with a 3-step path (Tune, Rhythm, Song)
- Reframe Progress as Rewards in the child-facing UI
- Gate Parent Zone access behind a long-press in the More menu

## Consequences
- Faster path to practice with fewer choices upfront
- Rewards language is more motivating for kids
- Long-press gate reduces accidental entry while keeping keyboard access
