Emerson Violin PWA – Quick Install

This app must be served over HTTPS to install as a PWA on iPadOS 26.2.
Sending a zip over iMessage is fine, but the receiver still needs a hosted URL.

Option A (fastest if you have hosting already)
1) Upload the contents of this folder to any static HTTPS host.
2) Open the URL in Safari on iPad.
3) Share > Add to Home Screen.

Option B (preview on same Wi‑Fi)
1) On a Mac, run: ./start-preview.sh
2) On iPad (same Wi‑Fi), open the Network URL it prints.
3) This is for preview only; PWA install + offline requires HTTPS.

Once installed, the app runs locally and works offline.
